=================
This is my fork of Macfusion2 intended to work on Mountain Lion using FUSE for OS X.

So far, this has been fairly stable on OS X 10.8.4. I've been using the client on-and-off for remote access to a server. I'm running OSXFUSE 2.5.1 along with it.

For now, there is a working version that I previously built at 
[Macfusion Agent Crashes in Mountain Lion](http://www.danielzhang.info/drupal6/content/macfusion-agent-crashes-in-mountain-lion).
